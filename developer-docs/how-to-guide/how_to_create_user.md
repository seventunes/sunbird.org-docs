## Scenario

A company, XYZ Corp, is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 5 locations. Employee training and enablement is one of the core values of the organization. To ensure that employees are regularly trained and upskilled, XYZ Corp has decided to use Sunbird for its learning and training solution. To give employees access to the learning platform, the organization's administrator needs to create and add user details. 

Every user belongs to an organization and is identified within the organization through a unique user ID. Sunbird, uniquely identifies every tenant organization through a channel. Hence, when creating a user, its not enough to only add user details and assign a user ID. To enable users, the user ID has to be associated with an organization and channel. Since a user also plays a role within an organization, the user gets fully enabled only after the user ID is associated to a role. For example, John is a manager in XYZ corporation with multiple roles, who can create, review and take courses. He is also an administrator in the system, in which capacity he can add users and assign permissions to them.  

### Prerequisites

1. An intialized Sunbird instance

2. The [API Key for access](http://www.sunbird.org) and basic authentication

4. Access to the [Create User API](http://www.sunbird.org/apis/userapi/#operation/Create%20User)

### Taskflow

1. Specify values for the parameters in the request body of the API. Following is an example of request body for creating a user, the sample values provided in the request body are indicative:
