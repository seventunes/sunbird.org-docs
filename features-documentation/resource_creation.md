## Overview

Sunbird houses a wide variety of content. Users can directly create content on Sunbird or upload content created offline. For more details on uploading content, created offline, refer <a href="features-documentation/upload" target="_blank">Uploading Content</a>

Resources  are the simplest/smallest unit of content that can be created by any user on Sunbird using the inbuilt content editor.The various categories of resources that can be created on Sunbird include:

- Experiment
- Learn
- Play
- Practice
- Read
- Teach
- Test 

Each of these categories corresponds to the learning process/methodology that is deployed to teach a particular piece of content. For example, a tutor creates an activity and the intent is to educate the learner about a concept through a game. The resource category in this case is, Play. Similarly, a tutor creates a story to enhance the reading skills of the learner, the story falls under the category of Read. 

This page details the procedure of creating resources on Sunbird.
