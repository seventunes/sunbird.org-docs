## Overview

Sunbird houses a wide variety of content. Users can can create content on Sunbird or upload content created offline. 

**Note:** For details on uploading content that is created offine, refer <a href="features-documentation/upload" target="_blank">Uploading Content</a>

A user with content creation rights can use Sunbird's inbuilt content editor to create **Resources** that are Sunbird's simplest or smallest unit of content.

You can create the following categories of resources on Sunbird:

- Experiment
- Learn
- Play
- Practice
- Read
- Teach
- Test 

Each of these categories corresponds to a stage or intent of the learning process or methodology that is used by tutors to impart knowledge of the subject. For example, a tutor intends to educate learners of a concept through a game. When the tutor creates the game, the category of the resource (the game) is, **Play**. Similarly, if a tutor creates a story to enhance the reading skills of learners, the category of the resource (the story) is, **Read**. 

This page details how to create resources using the inbuilt content editor.
